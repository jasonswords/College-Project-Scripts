Professional Penetration Testing
Digital Forensics & Cyber Security
Dublin Technical University
As a pentester you need to develop your own personal arsenal of weapons that you use when performing your 
own pentests. Researching and evaluating new tools is a consistent requirement to ensure you are up to date with 
the best tools and techniques. 
In this section I'll highlight a few of the many tools and resources available for passive reconnaissance. Kali Linux 
has entire sections of pre
-
installed tools for each stage of a pentest but you should always play with each tool to 
find your favourites.
A large number of the tools in this section are web based or require an active internet connection. I highly 
recommend you use the Firefox browser because of the number of useful add
-
ons and also create a folder of 
bookmarks containing links to all your favourite online recon/ information gather tools. 
I also recommend creating your own checklist of information that you should try and find during this stage, this 
evolving checklist should guide your activities during this stage.
